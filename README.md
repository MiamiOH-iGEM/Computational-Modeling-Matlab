# Computational-Modeling-Matlab
C4_Collaboration
All analyses were done using Matlab R2020a and Python3.

main.py: Python file used to edit the models to create the 3 models of interest by adding the appropriate reactions
C4_MiamiOH.mlx: Matlab script used to load, add sink reactions, and run the analysis on the models

The but, mal, and malbut files contain the following for each model
a. json file for Escher visualization of model
b. mat file for matlab use of model
c. text file indicating the applicable reaction changes to the model
